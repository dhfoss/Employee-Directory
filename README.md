### Description
Link: https://dhfoss.github.io/employee-directory/  
This is an app for viewing and sorting information about a list of employees. The user can search for employees by last names, and the results can be sorted alphabetically, by email, and by location.

### Technologies
This app uses React to dynamically generate the html, and Random User API to generate a list of 100 fake employees.

### Installation
To run locally, run `npm install` in the root directory to download the dependencies, then `npm start` to run the app.

### Usage
When the app is loaded, the user is shown a list of 100 employees (from Random User API). They are automatically sorted alphabetically by last name.

To search for a specific employee, begin typing in the search bar. The list will filter out any employees whose last name contains the letters currently in the search bar.

Finally, the results can be filtered by name, email, city, or country by clicking any of the corresponding buttons.
